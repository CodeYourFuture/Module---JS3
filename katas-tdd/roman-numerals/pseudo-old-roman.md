const assert = require('assert');

This line imports the 'assert' module from the Node.js standard library. The 'assert' module provides a set of assertion functions that are used to check if values meet certain conditions. We'll use the 'assert.strictEqual' function from this module to compare the results of our 'convertToOldRoman' function with the expected outputs.

function convertToOldRoman(number) {
  const romanNumerals = {
    M: 1000,
    CM: 900,
    D: 500,
    CD: 400,
    C: 100,
    XC: 90,
    L: 50,
    XL: 40,
    X: 10,
    IX: 9,
    V: 5,
    IV: 4,
    I: 1,
  };

  let result = '';

  for (let numeral in romanNumerals) {
    while (number >= romanNumerals[numeral]) {
      result += numeral;
      number -= romanNumerals[numeral];
    }
  }

  return result;
}


The convertToOldRoman function takes a number as an argument and converts it to an old Roman numeral.
Inside the function, we have an object called romanNumerals that maps each Roman numeral to its corresponding Arabic value. The object is defined in descending order of value, which is important for the conversion algorithm.
We initialize an empty string variable called result to store the resulting Roman numeral.
We then iterate over the Roman numerals in the romanNumerals object using a for...in loop. For each numeral, we check if the current number is greater than or equal to the corresponding Arabic value of that numeral. If it is, we add the numeral to the result string and subtract the corresponding value from the number. We repeat this process until the number is less than the value of the current numeral.
Finally, we return the result string containing the old Roman numeral representation of the original number.

  // Test cases here...
});


The it function is used to define an individual test case within the test suite. It takes a description of the test case as the first argument.
Inside the test case, we call the convertToOldRoman function with the Arabic number 4 and store the result in the result variable.
Then, we use the assert.strictEqual function to compare the result variable with the expected output 'IIII'. If the result matches the expected output, the test case passes. Otherwise, it fails and provides an error message.
You'll notice another test case defined in a similar manner to cover converting the Arabic number 9 to the Roman numeral 'VIIII'.
By running the test suite, you can validate whether the convertToOldRoman function behaves as expected and correctly converts Arabic numbers to old Roman numerals.
Remember to install a testing framework like Mocha or Jest and run the test file using the appropriate command to execute the test cases and verify.
